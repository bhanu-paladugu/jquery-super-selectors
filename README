Super Selectors is a jQuery plugin enabling better CSS selector support for older browsers

TODO:
* Finish demo page
* Add appropriate rules on the fly, so that users won't need to include the classes in their CSS. This will involve modifying the regular expressions.


WARNING:
IE has a "fun" habit of discarding any style rules which contain selectors it cannot parse. This can cause unintended results. The only reliable workaround I've found is to declare your rules twice, so that the super-selector version will still be applied.

So, instead of 

	div.example > :first-child,
	div.example .first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}

You should write:

	div.example > :first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}

	div.example .first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}
