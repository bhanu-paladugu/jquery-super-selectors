Super Selectors is a jQuery plugin enabling better CSS selector support for older browsers

TODO:
* Finish demo page
* Create test page (should use embedded, linked, and imported stylesheets)
* Allow users to pass in their classes to bypass having to parse stylesheets to know which selectors to add classes to. We should also allow users to *force* stylesheets to be parsed, in case they may know some of the selectors but not all


WARNING:
IE has a "fun" habit of discarding any style rules which contain selectors it cannot parse. This can cause unintended results. The only reliable workaround I've found is to declare your rules twice, so that the super-selector version will still be applied.

So, instead of 

	div.example > :first-child,
	div.example .first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}

You should write:

	div.example > :first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}

	div.example .first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}
