Super Selectors is a jQuery plugin enabling better CSS selector support for older browsers

TODO:
* Finish demo page
* Create test page (should use embedded, linked, and imported stylesheets)
* Check the regular expressions - they're not my strong suit, so we may not be matching everything properly (among other issues, the "directChildMatch" generates an error right now)


WARNING:
IE has a "fun" habit of discarding any style rules which contain selectors it cannot parse. This can cause unintended results. The only reliable workaround I've found is to declare your rules twice, so that the super-selector version will still be applied.

So, instead of 

	div.example > :first-child,
	div.example .first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}

You should write:

	div.example > :first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}

	div.example .first-child {
	background: #0f0;
	color: #f0f;
	}
